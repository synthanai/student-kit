# Professional Profile — Section 4: PROFESSIONAL GROWTH — Where You Want to Develop 🌱

**Goal**: Surface professional gaps, career challenge response, AI vulnerability awareness, aspirations. Weave examples naturally.

## Questions

**4.1 Self-Identified Professional Gap**
"Looking at what we've talked about — how you learn for work, solve problems, and deliver results — what professional skill do you KNOW you need to work on? Some people know their presentations are weak, others know they procrastinate on big deliverables, some struggle with taking initiative, and others want better time management. What's holding you back?"

**4.2 Career Challenge Response**
"When you're thrown into a professional situation you're not ready for — leading a meeting, presenting to executives, handling a difficult stakeholder — how do you respond? Some people rise to the challenge, others fake confidence until they figure it out, some freeze, and some immediately ask for support from a colleague."

**4.3 Professional Growth Aspiration**
"If you could level up one professional skill this year, what would it be? Could be anything — leadership, presenting, writing, networking, technical skills, time management, project management, negotiation."

**4.4 AI Vulnerability Awareness**
"Which of your professional skills do you think AI could do better or replace? And which are uniquely YOURS — things AI can't replicate? For example, AI can write a solid first draft of a report, but it can't navigate office politics or build trust with a difficult client. What's YOUR version of that split?"

**4.5 Professional Feedback Preference**
"When AI helps you with work, how do you want it to work? Some people want the finished product — 'just give me the answer.' Others want to be walked through the thought process. Some want AI to challenge them: 'are you sure that's the right approach?' And some want it to depend on the situation. What's your preference?"
