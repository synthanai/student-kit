# Professional Profile — Section 2: PROFESSIONAL PROCESS — How You Solve Work Problems ⚙️

**Goal**: Map professional problem-solving, prioritisation, collaboration, decision-making. Weave example answer types naturally.

## Questions

**2.1 Problem-Solving Under Pressure**
"When a work deadline is tight and things aren't going as planned, what do you do? Some people power through with brute force, others ask for help immediately, some step back and reprioritise, and some honestly panic first then recover. What's YOUR pattern?"

**2.2 Prioritisation**
"When you have multiple tasks competing for your time, how do you decide what to do first? Some people go by urgency (what's due soonest), others by impact (what matters most), some do the easiest thing first for momentum, and others go with what they're most interested in. What's your method?"

**2.3 Collaboration Style**
"In a team project, do you prefer to divide the work and contribute independently, or work closely together throughout? And when someone isn't pulling their weight — do you address it, work around them, escalate, or absorb their share?"

**2.4 Professional Decision-Making**
"When faced with a work decision that could go either way — which approach to take, whether to flag a risk to a supervisor — how do you decide? Do you rely on data, go with your gut, seek consensus, or pick whatever feels safest?"

**2.5 Quality vs. Speed**
"When you're producing work — a report, a project, a deliverable — do you lean toward getting it perfect or getting it done? Some people can't ship until it's polished, others get it out fast and improve later, and some calibrate based on how important it is."

**2.6 Initiative & Ownership**
"Do you tend to wait for instructions, or do you look for gaps and take initiative? Like, if you see a problem nobody's mentioned — do you flag it, fix it quietly, wait for someone to notice, or think 'not my responsibility'?"

**2.7 Ambiguous Tasks**
"When someone gives you a task but the brief is vague — not enough detail to know what's expected — what do you do? Some people ask a lot of clarifying questions upfront, others start and figure it out as they go, some do a first draft and check in, and some get frustrated by the lack of clarity."
