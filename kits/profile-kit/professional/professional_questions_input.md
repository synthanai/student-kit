# Professional Profile — Section 1: PROFESSIONAL INPUT — How You Absorb Work Knowledge 📥

**Goal**: Map how they consume professional information. Weave example answer types naturally.

## Questions

**1.1 Professional Research**
"When you need to learn something for a project or work task — a new tool, a process, a concept — how do you go about it? Some people read documentation, others watch tutorial videos, some ask a colleague immediately, and others just start clicking around and learn by trial-and-error. What's your approach?"

**1.2 Meeting/Briefing Behaviour**
"In a meeting, team briefing, or project update — what are you actually doing? Taking detailed notes? Listening and processing internally? Asking questions as they come up? Or do you check out and process it all later? Be honest."

**1.3 Technical vs. Conceptual**
"When learning work-related stuff, do you need the big-picture WHY first — like 'here's why this matters' — or do you prefer to dive into the HOW-TO and figure out the theory later? Some people need context before detail, others just want the steps."

**1.4 Feedback Absorption**
"When a manager, supervisor, or tutor gives you feedback on your work — how do you take it in? Some people process on the spot and respond immediately, others need a day to sit with it, some get emotionally reactive first then rationalise, and some immediately start applying it without much reflection."

**1.5 Professional Reading**
"Do you actively read industry-related content — articles, reports, case studies, newsletters? Or do you mainly learn through doing the work and talking to people? Some people are readers, others are doers."

**1.6 Skill Acquisition Speed**
"When you need to learn a new skill for work — software, technique, methodology — are you a fast self-starter who figures it out alone, or do you prefer structured training where someone walks you through it?"

**1.7 Information Filtering**
"In a work context, when you're given a LOT of information — a long project brief, a data dump, a 50-email thread — how do you extract what matters? Do you read everything cover to cover, skim for the key points, or ask someone to give you the summary?"
