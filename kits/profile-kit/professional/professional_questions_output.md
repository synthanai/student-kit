# Professional Profile — Section 3: PROFESSIONAL OUTPUT — How You Deliver & Present 📤

**Goal**: Map deliverable style, presentation ability, stakeholder communication, documentation. Weave example answer types naturally.

## Questions

**3.1 Deliverable Format**
"When you produce work — a report, a project, a presentation — what does your natural output look like? Some people create detailed, polished documents, others go functional and minimal ('here's what you need'), some make it visual and designed, and others focus on data and structure. What's yours?"

**3.2 Presentation Style**
"Have you presented to a group before — class presentation, pitch, team update? How do you feel about it? Some people love it and thrive on stage, others are nervous but deliver well, and some would rather do literally anything else. If you do present, what's your style — heavy on slides, storytelling, data-driven, or just talking it through?"

**3.3 Professional Writing**
"When you write professionally — an email to a supervisor, a project report, a LinkedIn post — how does it compare to how you write personally? Some people become much more formal, others stay pretty much the same, and some shift their structure but keep their voice."

**3.4 Stakeholder Communication**
"When you need to update someone on progress — manager, professor, client — how do you do it? Some people give proactive updates before being asked, others wait until someone checks in, some send structured status reports, and others fire off quick messages."

**3.5 Documentation**
"Do you naturally document your work — like keeping notes on processes, decisions, progress? Or do you keep most of it in your head? Some people are obsessive note-takers, others document only when forced, and some have no documentation habit at all."

**3.6 Professional Brand & Visibility**
"Do you think about how others perceive your work? Like, are you building a professional reputation consciously, or do you just focus on doing the work well and hope people notice?"

**3.7 Output Under Professional Pressure**
"When a deadline is close and time is running out — does the quality of your output stay consistent, drop noticeably, or sometimes actually IMPROVE under pressure? Some people do their best work at the last minute."
