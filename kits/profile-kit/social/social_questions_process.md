# Social Profile — Section 2: SOCIAL PROCESS — How You Navigate Relationships ⚙️

**Goal**: Map conflict style, group dynamics, boundaries, social decisions, recovery. Weave example answer types naturally.

## Questions

**2.1 Conflict Style**
"When you have a real disagreement with a friend — not a small thing, actual tension — what do you do? Some people address it head-on right away, others avoid it and hope it fades, some wait for the other person to bring it up, and some process it with a different friend first before deciding. What's YOUR pattern?"

**2.2 Group Dynamics**
"In a group project or social hangout, what role do you naturally fall into? Like, are you the one who takes charge, the mediator who smooths things over, the person quietly doing the actual work, the ideas person who sparks energy, or the one who keeps everyone chill?"

**2.3 Boundary Setting**
"Are you good at saying no? When someone asks too much — takes your time, crosses a line — some people set firm boundaries calmly, others say yes and resent it later, some avoid the situation entirely, and some are getting better at it but it's still hard. Where are you?"

**2.4 Social Decision-Making**
"When you have to choose between what YOU want and what's best for the group — e.g., speaking up vs. keeping the peace — which way do you lean? Some people always prioritise harmony, others prioritise honesty, and some switch depending on the stakes."

**2.5 Social Stress Processing**
"After a socially draining situation — an argument, an awkward encounter, a big event — how do you recover? Do you need alone time to decompress, need to talk it through with someone, distract yourself completely, or process it silently on your own?"

**2.6 Cultural & Context Switching**
"Do you operate differently in different social contexts? Like, are you a different person with family vs. friends vs. classmates vs. strangers? Some people code-switch heavily, others are pretty much the same person everywhere."

**2.7 Vulnerability**
"How comfortable are you being vulnerable with people — sharing what you actually feel, admitting you're wrong, asking for help? Some people are open books, others share selectively with trusted people only, and some keep walls up in most situations."
