# Social Profile — Section 3: SOCIAL OUTPUT — How You Communicate & Influence 📤

**Goal**: Map communication style, persuasion, social presence, feedback delivery. Weave example answer types naturally.

## Questions

**3.1 Communication Style**
"When you need to tell someone something important — good news, bad news, a request, an apology — how do you deliver it? Face-to-face? Long text? Quick call? And do you prepare what you'll say, or go with the moment? Some people script everything in their head first, others just wing it."

**3.2 Persuasion Approach**
"When you want someone to see your point of view — not fighting, just trying to influence — what's your natural approach? Some people use logic and facts, others use emotional appeal, some tell stories to make their point, and others lead by example without arguing at all."

**3.3 Social Expression**
"In group conversations, are you the one who speaks up a lot, or do you observe and only drop in when you have something important? Like, some people fill silence naturally, others are strategic — they speak rarely but it lands when they do."

**3.4 Feedback Delivery**
"If a friend asks for your honest opinion and the truth might hurt — how do you handle that? Some people are totally honest even if it's uncomfortable, others are diplomatic and cushion it, some soften it until it barely sounds like criticism, and some avoid the hardest part entirely."

**3.5 Humour & Connection**
"What role does humour play in how you connect with people? For some people it's their main social tool — they bond through jokes and banter. For others it's nice but not central. And some connect more through deep conversations than humour."

**3.6 Written vs. Verbal Social Expression**
"Are you better at expressing yourself in writing or in person? Like, some people are way more articulate in a text or email, while others come alive in face-to-face conversation. Where are you stronger?"

**3.7 Influence Awareness**
"Are you aware of your impact on others? Like, do you notice if you change the energy in a room, if you make someone smile or uncomfortable? Or is that something you don't think about much? Some people are hyper-aware, others genuinely don't notice."
