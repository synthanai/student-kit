# Social Profile — Section 1: SOCIAL INPUT — How You Read People 📥

**Goal**: Map how they absorb social information. Weave example answer types naturally into each question.

## Questions

**1.1 First Impressions**
"When you meet someone new — at a party, in a class, at work — what do you notice FIRST? Like, some people pick up on body language immediately, others focus on what the person says, some read the energy or vibe, and others watch how they treat the people around them. What grabs YOUR attention?"

**1.2 Listening Pattern**
"When a friend is telling you about a problem, what's your natural mode? Some people listen quietly without interrupting, others jump in with questions, some immediately try to solve it, and others relate it back to their own experience — 'oh that happened to me too.' What do YOU do?"

**1.3 Group Awareness**
"In a group setting — a class discussion, a party, a team meeting — how aware are you of the group dynamics? Like, do you naturally notice who's uncomfortable, who's dominating, who's being left out? Or do you tend to focus on your own thoughts and only notice your own experience?"

**1.4 Trust Formation**
"How long does it take you to trust someone? Some people trust fast — everyone gets the benefit of the doubt until they mess up. Others are slow and deliberate — trust has to be earned over time. And some are somewhere in between depending on the context. Where do you sit?"

**1.5 Empathy Style**
"When someone close to you is upset, what's your instinct? Do you FEEL what they're feeling (like it physically hits you), do you try to UNDERSTAND logically why they're upset, or do you skip the feelings and jump into ACTION to help fix it?"

**1.6 Social Media vs. Real Life**
"How do you read people differently online vs. in person? Like, some people are great at reading a room face-to-face but miss nuance in texts. Others are the opposite — they pick up on every word choice in a message. Are you better at reading people in one medium?"
