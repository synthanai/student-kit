# Social Profile  -  Section 4: SOCIAL GROWTH  -  Where You Want to Develop 🌱

**Goal**: Surface social skills gaps, challenge response, aspirations. Weave example answer types naturally.

## Questions

**4.1 Self-Identified Social Gap**
"Of everything we've talked about  -  reading people, handling conflict, communicating, setting boundaries  -  what's the one social skill you KNOW you need to work on? Like, some people know they avoid confrontation, others know they dominate conversations, some want to be better listeners. What's yours?"

**4.2 Social Challenge Response**
"When you're pushed into an uncomfortable social situation  -  a confrontation, public speaking, networking with strangers, being vulnerable  -  how do you react? Some people step up and get energised, others freeze in the moment, some deflect with humour, and some find a way to avoid it entirely."

**4.3 Social Growth Aspiration**
"If you could be better at ONE social thing by the end of this year, what would it be? Could be anything  -  setting boundaries, public speaking, reading body language, handling difficult conversations, networking, being more assertive."

**4.4 Social Feedback Preference**
"When AI helps you think about social situations  -  conflict, communication, relationships  -  how do you want that help? Some people want direct advice: 'say this.' Others want reflective questions that help them figure it out. Others prefer examples and stories. And some just want AI to listen and summarise what they said. What works for you?"
