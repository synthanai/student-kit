# Personal Profile — Section 4: GROWTH — Where You Want to Develop 🌱

**Goal**: Identify gaps, challenge response, and growth aspirations. Weave example answer types naturally.

## Questions

**4.1 Self-Identified Gaps**
"Looking at what we've talked about — how you learn, think, and express — is there anything you WISH you were better at? For example, some people know they procrastinate but can't stop, others wish they could focus longer, some want to be better at expressing ideas clearly. What's yours?"

**4.2 Challenge Response**
"When someone pushes you outside your comfort zone — a tough question, an unfamiliar format, an unexpected challenge — how do you typically react? Some people rise to it and get energised, others resist at first but come around, some need encouragement before they'll try, and some honestly shut down. What's your pattern?"

**4.3 Growth Aspiration**
"If you could level up one personal skill this year — not academic, just personal — what would it be? Could be anything: better focus, more consistency, stronger writing, more confidence, better time management."

**4.4 Feedback Preference**
"When AI or a teacher gives you feedback, how do you want it? Some people want it direct and blunt — 'this is wrong, fix it.' Others want it gentle with encouragement. Some prefer the sandwich — positive, constructive, positive. And some just want to see the fix without the commentary. What works for you?"
