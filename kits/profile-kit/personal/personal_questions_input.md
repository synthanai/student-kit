# Personal Profile  -  Section 1: INPUT  -  How You Learn 📥

**Goal**: Map their complete learning profile. With each question, weave in 2-3 example answer types so the student knows what kind of response you're looking for. Don't list them mechanically  -  make them part of the question naturally.

## Questions

**1.1 Format Preference**
"When you need to learn something new for uni  -  a concept you don't understand yet  -  what do you actually do? Like, some people go straight to YouTube, others open the textbook, some ask a friend to explain it, and some just Google until they find a summary that clicks. What's YOUR go-to?"

**1.2 Depth vs. Breadth**
"When you find a topic interesting, do you go deep  -  like reading 5 articles and watching documentaries about it  -  or do you get the key idea and move on? Some people are rabbit-hole divers, others are 'give me the summary' people."

**1.3 Structure Preference**
"Do you learn better with clear structure  -  like 'Step 1, Step 2, Step 3'  -  or do you prefer to explore and figure it out yourself? For example, would you rather follow a tutorial step-by-step, or tinker with the tool and learn by breaking things?"

**1.4 Retention Method**
"After a lecture or study session, what actually helps the content STICK? Some people rewrite their notes, some talk about it with friends, some do practice problems, and some honestly just sleep on it and hope for the best. Be honest  -  what do you ACTUALLY do, not what you think you should do?"

**1.5 Environment & Conditions**
"Where do you do your best learning? Like, some people need total silence in the library, others work better in a cafe with background noise, some study best in bed at midnight. What's your setup?"

**1.6 Motivation Pattern**
"What makes you WANT to learn something? Is it genuine curiosity about the topic, the pressure of a deadline, competing with classmates, fear of failing, or something else? For example, do you study ahead because you're interested, or cram because the exam forces you to?"

**1.7 Information Overwhelm**
"When you're given too much information  -  a massive reading list, a dense 2-hour lecture  -  what's your instinct? Some people power through everything, some skim for the key points, some break it into chunks across days, and some avoid it entirely until pressure forces them. Which one sounds like you?"
