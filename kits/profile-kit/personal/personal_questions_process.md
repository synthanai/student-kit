# Personal Profile  -  Section 2: PROCESS  -  How You Think ⚙️

**Goal**: Map their reasoning style, decision-making, emotional processing, focus, and ambiguity tolerance. Weave example answer types naturally into each question.

## Questions

**2.1 Reasoning Style**
"When you're faced with a big personal decision  -  like choosing a major, moving cities, or ending a relationship  -  how do you work through it? Some people make a pros/cons list, others go with their gut and decide in seconds, some need to talk it through with 5 different people first. What's your move?"

**2.2 Problem-Solving Approach**
"When you're stuck on a difficult assignment, what do you do FIRST? Like, do you step away and come back later, try harder and push through, Google everything, ask a friend, or scrap it and start from scratch? What's your actual first instinct?"

**2.3 Ambiguity Tolerance**
"How do you handle situations with no clear right answer  -  like an essay question with multiple valid arguments? Some people love the openness and thrive in it, others find it stressful and wish someone would just tell them the 'right' answer. Where do you sit?"

**2.4 Focus & Attention**
"How long can you typically focus before you need a break? Like, are you a 20-minute burst person, a 45-minute focused block person, or can you lock in for hours? And when you lose focus, what pulls you away  -  your phone, daydreaming, restlessness, hunger?"

**2.5 Emotional Processing**
"When something goes wrong  -  a bad grade, a personal setback  -  what's your first reaction? Some people immediately analyse what went wrong, others feel the emotions first and process later, some talk to someone right away, and some just bury it and push forward. What do YOU do?"

**2.6 Reflection Habit**
"Do you naturally reflect on WHY things went well or badly? Like, after an exam, do you think about what worked and what didn't, or do you just check the grade and move on to the next thing?"

**2.7 Planning vs. Spontaneity**
"Are you a planner or a wing-it person? For example, when you have a free day  -  do you structure it with a to-do list, or see what happens? And does the same apply to how you study?"
