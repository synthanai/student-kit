# Personal Profile  -  Section 3: OUTPUT  -  How You Express 📤

**Goal**: Map how they communicate, create, and deliver in personal contexts. Weave example answer types naturally into each question.

## Questions

**3.1 Natural Writing Style**
"When you're writing for yourself  -  a text to a friend, a journal entry, a social post  -  how do you naturally write? Like, some people are short and punchy ('lol ok'), some write long detailed paragraphs, some are super casual, and some are surprisingly structured even in texts. What's your vibe?"

**3.2 Communication Preference**
"If you need to explain a complicated idea to a friend, what do you prefer  -  writing it out in a message, sending a voice note, drawing something, or just explaining face-to-face? Some people are way better in writing, others need to talk it through."

**3.3 Answer vs. Story**
"When someone asks you a question, do you give a direct answer and stop, or do you give the backstory and build up to the point? Like, if someone asks 'how was your weekend?'  -  do you say 'good' or do you tell the whole story?"

**3.4 Creative Expression**
"Do you have any creative outlets  -  writing, music, art, content creation, cooking, building things? Or are you more of a consumer than a creator? Some people are active creators, others have the itch but haven't started yet."

**3.5 Perfectionism**
"When you're working on something you care about  -  a personal project, an important message, an assignment  -  do you polish and revise it five times, or do you go with the first version that feels right? Some people are 'ship it now' people, others can't stop editing."

**3.6 Format Under Pressure**
"When you're short on time and need to get your point across fast, what does your output look like? Bullet points? One long paragraph? A voice note? A quick sketch? For example, if you had 2 minutes to explain something  -  what format comes naturally?"

**3.7 Ideas vs. Action**
"Are you more of an ideas person or an execution person? Like, do you love brainstorming and coming up with plans but struggle to finish them, or are you better at taking someone else's plan and making it happen?"
