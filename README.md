## What Is Student Kit?

Student Kit is a collection of **open-source AI tools** designed specifically for students. Each tool (called a **kit**) is self-contained, free to use, and built to solve a real student problem.

The first kit — **Profile Kit** — helps you build a personalised AI that actually understands how you learn, think, and work. Instead of using generic ChatGPT, you create an AI tuned to YOUR brain.

> **KIT** = **K**nowledge · **I**ntuition · **T**ooling
>
> Every kit in this repo falls into one of these three categories:
> - **Knowledge** — tools that help you learn and retain information better
> - **Intuition** — tools that develop your judgment, self-awareness, and decision-making
> - **Tooling** — practical AI tools that make your student life more productive

## Available Kits

| Kit | Category | Status | Description |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------|
| 🧬 [Profile Kit](kits/profile-kit/) | Intuition | ✅ Complete | Build your 3×3 AI profile across Personal, Social, and Professional domains |
| 📚 Study Kit | Knowledge | 🔜 Coming | AI-powered study strategies tuned to your learning profile |
| 💼 Career Kit | Tooling | 🔜 Coming | CV, interview prep, and career navigation tools |
| 🧘 Wellness Kit | Intuition | 🔜 Coming | Stress management and wellbeing tools for student life |

## Quick Start

**Want to build your AI profile right now?** → Go to **[Profile Kit](kits/profile-kit/)**

It takes 15-20 minutes per profile. You'll get a personalised AI instruction set to paste into a ChatGPT Project. Here's what happens:

```
You → Profile GPT (15 min chat) → PIC instruction set → paste into ChatGPT Project → personalised AI
```

Your AI will:
- ✅ Deliver content the way YOUR brain absorbs it
- ✅ Frame problems the way YOU think through them
- ✅ Communicate the way YOU prefer
- ✅ Help you grow in areas you choose — gently, over time

## Workshops

| Workshop | Duration | Kit(s) Used | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 🎤 [AI Profiling Seminar](workshops/ai-profiling-seminar/) | 60 min | Profile Kit | Live session where students build their profiles and see AI respond differently |

Workshops include facilitator guides, timed outlines, and all materials needed to run the session.

## Philosophy

**In the AI era, the students who win aren't the ones who use AI the most — they're the ones AI understands the best.**

Most students use ChatGPT the same way: open a new chat, ask a question, get a generic answer. Student Kit changes that. By profiling how you learn, think, communicate, and work, you give AI the context it needs to serve you personally.

Your profile has a PIC strategy:
- **Layer 1: Persona** — who you are (your patterns)
- **Layer 2: Interface** — how AI should serve you (your preferences)
- **Layer 3: Compass** — how AI should grow you (your development areas)

## The 3×3 Matrix

Every student operates across 3 domains, each with 3 capabilities:

|  | 📥 Input | ⚙️ Process | 📤 Output |
|--|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 🧠 **Personal** | How you learn | How you think | How you express |
| 🤝 **Social** | How you read people | How you navigate relationships | How you communicate |
| 💼 **Professional** | How you absorb work knowledge | How you solve work problems | How you deliver results |

Profile Kit maps all 9 cells. The result: an AI that knows your complete operating system.
