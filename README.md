## What Is Student Kit?

Student Kit is a collection of **open-source AI tools** designed specifically for students. Each tool (called a **kit**) is standalone, free to use, and built to solve a real student problem.

The first kit  -  **Profile Kit**  -  helps you build three personalised AIs that actually understand how you learn, think, and work. Each profile produces its own PIC that goes into its own ChatGPT Project.

> **KIT** = **K**nowledge · **I**ntuition · **T**ooling
>
> Every kit in this repo falls into one of these three categories:
> - **Knowledge**  -  tools that help you learn and retain information better
> - **Intuition**  -  tools that develop your judgment, self-awareness, and decision-making
> - **Tooling**  -  practical AI tools that make your student life more productive

## Available Kits

| Kit | Category | Status | Description |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------|
| 🧬 [Profile Kit](kits/profile-kit/) | Intuition | ✅ Complete | Build your 3×3 AI profile across Personal, Social, and Professional domains |
| 📚 Study Kit | Knowledge | 🔜 Coming | AI-powered study strategies tuned to your learning profile |
| 💼 Career Kit | Tooling | 🔜 Coming | CV, interview prep, and career navigation tools |
| 🧘 Wellness Kit | Intuition | 🔜 Coming | Stress management and wellbeing tools for student life |

## Quick Start

**Want to build your AI profile right now?** → Go to **[Profile Kit](kits/profile-kit/)**

It takes 15-20 minutes per profile. You'll get a personalised AI instruction set to paste into a ChatGPT Project. Here's what happens:

```
You → Personal GPT (15 min) → Personal PIC → paste into ChatGPT Project → your Study AI
You → Social GPT (15 min)   → Social PIC   → paste into ChatGPT Project → your Social AI
You → Professional GPT (15 min) → Professional PIC → paste into ChatGPT Project → your Career AI
```

Your AI will:
- ✅ Deliver content the way YOUR brain absorbs it
- ✅ Frame problems the way YOU think through them
- ✅ Communicate the way YOU prefer
- ✅ Help you grow in areas you choose  -  gently, over time

## Workshops

| Workshop | Duration | Kit(s) Used | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 🎤 [AI Profiling Seminar](workshops/ai-profiling-seminar/) | 60 min | Profile Kit | Live session where students build their profiles and see AI respond differently |

Workshops include facilitator guides, timed outlines, and all materials needed to run the session.

## Philosophy

**Recognition** → **Revelation** → **Revolution**

You use AI every day. But AI treats you the same as every other student on the planet. That's the problem. Your profile is the fix. It turns a generic tool into a partner that actually gets you.

> **Every student needs a Profile PIC**  -  your **P**ersona, **I**nterface, and **C**ompass. You need one for each context.

### Three PICs. Three Projects. Three AI Partners.

| Profile | What It Reveals | Your AI Partner |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 🧠 **Personal PIC** | How you learn, think, and express ideas | Your **Study AI**  -  matches your brain |
| 🤝 **Social PIC** | How you read people, navigate relationships, and communicate | Your **Social AI**  -  adapts to your style |
| 💼 **Professional PIC** | How you absorb work knowledge, solve problems, and deliver results | Your **Career AI**  -  supports your growth |

Each PIC is a separate conversation and a separate ChatGPT Project because **you show up differently in each domain**  -  the way you study isn't the way you socialise, and the way you socialise isn't the way you work. Keep them separate. The clarity matters.

## The 3×3 Matrix

Every student operates across 3 domains, each with 3 capabilities:

|  | 📥 Input | ⚙️ Process | 📤 Output |
|--|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 🧠 **Personal** | How you learn | How you think | How you express |
| 🤝 **Social** | How you read people | How you navigate relationships | How you communicate |
| 💼 **Professional** | How you absorb work knowledge | How you solve work problems | How you deliver results |

Profile Kit maps all 9 cells  -  3 per profile. Each profile produces its own PIC. Three PICs, three AI partners, one complete you.
