# The 3×3 Profiling Matrix

## Overview

The 3×3 matrix maps how you operate across **3 domains** and **3 capabilities**:

|  | 📥 Input | ⚙️ Process | 📤 Output |
|--|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 🧠 **Personal** | How you learn | How you think | How you express |
| 🤝 **Social** | How you read people | How you navigate relationships | How you communicate |
| 💼 **Professional** | How you absorb work knowledge | How you solve work problems | How you deliver results |

This gives you **9 cells**  -  each one a specific dimension of how you operate.

## The Three Capabilities

### 📥 Input  -  How You Consume
How you absorb information, read situations, and take in the world around you.

| Domain | What it covers |
|--------|---------------|
| Personal | Format preference, depth orientation, retention method, motivation |
| Social | First impressions, listening pattern, empathy, trust formation |
| Professional | Research style, meeting behaviour, feedback absorption, learning |

### ⚙️ Process  -  How You Think
How you reason, decide, solve problems, and navigate complexity.

| Domain | What it covers |
|--------|---------------|
| Personal | Reasoning style, ambiguity tolerance, focus, emotional processing |
| Social | Conflict style, group role, boundaries, vulnerability |
| Professional | Problem-solving under pressure, prioritisation, collaboration, initiative |

### 📤 Output  -  How You Produce
How you express yourself, communicate, deliver, and create.

| Domain | What it covers |
|--------|---------------|
| Personal | Writing style, creative expression, perfectionism, ideas vs execution |
| Social | Communication channel, persuasion, social presence, influence awareness |
| Professional | Work output format, presentation style, communication with supervisors, documentation |

## The AI Vulnerability Overlay

Not all cells are equal in the AI era:

- **Professional Output**  -  AI replaces this fastest (report writing, data analysis, presentations)
- **Social Process**  -  AI can't touch this (navigating conflict, reading a room, building trust)
- **Personal Input**  -  Your learning style is uniquely yours; AI can't learn FOR you

The matrix helps you see which cells are your **strengths** (double down), which are your **gaps** (develop), and which are **AI-vulnerable** (evolve or be replaced).

## How It Becomes Instructions

Each cell produces specific, specific and usable instructions for AI:

```
Cell: Personal Input → "I learn best through video. Start with the big picture. Break into chunks."
Cell: Social Process → "I avoid conflict. Help me practise direct but kind confrontation."
Cell: Professional Output → "My presentations are weak. Help me practise storytelling delivery."
```

These instructions are organised into the PIC strategy:
1. **Persona**  -  the patterns from all 9 cells
2. **Interface**  -  how AI should serve those patterns
3. **Compass**  -  which cells to stretch and how
