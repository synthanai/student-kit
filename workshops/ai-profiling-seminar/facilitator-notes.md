## Slide-by-Slide Cue Sheet

> **Format:** ⏱ Timing · 🎬 Action · 🎤 Say · ⚠️ Watch For

---

### ACT 1 — OPENING: The Generalist Baseline (Slides 1–4)

#### Slide 1: TITLE
⏱ 0:00 · Let audience settle  
🎬 Stand centre. Pause. Let the Tamil verse land.  
🎤 Do not explain the verse — let it sit. Start with: *"AI doesn't know you. Yet."*

#### Slide 2: GENERALIST BASELINE — SETUP 🛠️
⏱ 0:00  
🎬 Get phones/laptops out. Everyone opens **ChatGPT**.  
🎤 *"Before we start. A quick experiment. Everyone get your phone or laptop out."*  
⚠️ Wait until 80%+ have screens open before advancing.

#### Slide 3: GENERALIST BASELINE — CREATE PROJECT 🛠️
⏱ 0:00  
🎬 Walk them through creating a ChatGPT Project — call it **"Generalist"**. No instructions, blank.  
🎤 *"Not a conversation. We're creating a Project. Name it Generalist. Leave everything blank."*  
⚠️ Some students won't find Projects — help them: sidebar → Projects → New.

#### Slide 4: GENERALIST BASELINE — ASK THE QUESTION 🛠️
⏱ 0:00  
🎬 Everyone types: **"How is AI going to impact my campus placement?"**  
🎤 *"Now ask it this. Exact words. Screenshot the answer."*  
⚠️ This answer becomes the reference for the Reveal on Slide 27.

---

### ACT 2 — THE PROBLEM: Why Generic AI Fails (Slides 5–12)

#### Slide 5: THE PROBLEM 🎤
⏱ 0:00 · 4 min  
🎤 *"Last night, 10,000 students asked the same question. They all got almost the same answer. Including you. You just proved it."*  
⚠️ Point at THEIR phones. They have the proof. Don't rush "you just proved it."

#### Slide 6: RECOGNITION
⏱ 0:02  
🎬 Hand-raise: *"How many got an answer that could have been written for anyone?"*  
🎤 Wait for hands — every hand should go up. *"Every hand. Because that's exactly how AI works without context."*  
⚠️ This is powerful because they just EXPERIENCED it 30 seconds ago.

#### Slide 7: REVELATION
⏱ 0:02  
🎤 *"This is the one. This is the moment where it stops being convenient and starts being weird."*  
⚠️ Energy shifts from 'relatable' to 'wait, that IS weird'. Lean into the pause.

#### Slide 8: THE HOPE 🎤
⏱ 0:03  
🎤 (Quietly) *"What if AI already knew how you think? How you learn? What you care about?"*  
⚠️ Quietest moment. Volume drops. Speed drops. Do NOT let energy rise yet.

#### Slide 9: THE STAKES — SETUP 🎤
⏱ 0:03  
🎤 *"The biggest problem you'll face after graduation isn't unemployment…"*  
⚠️ Hold 3 seconds. Let them read the hanging sentence. Don't complete it.

#### Slide 10: THE STAKES — PAYOFF 🎤
⏱ 0:03  
🎤 *"…but replaceability. 56% of 2025 seniors feel pessimistic about the job market."*  
⚠️ Stats are SPOKEN, never shown. The slide is the punch; your voice carries the data.

#### Slide 11: THE PUNCHLINE 🎤
⏱ 0:03  
🎤 (3-sec pause, let them read) *"This is the punchline. If AI treats you like everyone else, you become everyone else."*  
⚠️ Coin→Key metaphor is SPOKEN, never shown. It needs to be heard.

#### Slide 12: THE BRIDGE 🎤
⏱ 0:04  
🎤 *"That profile you just saw? You're going to build your own. In about 15 minutes. Today."*  
⚠️ Energy LIFTS. Lean forward, slightly faster. Faster/smarter/safer/complete — throw casually, don't emphasise.

---

### ACT 3 — THE FRAMEWORK: Three Specialisations (Slides 13–18)

#### Slide 13: THREE SPECIALISATIONS 🎤
⏱ 0:05  
🎬 Introduce the three PIC dimensions.  
🎤 *"Personal. Social. Professional. Three lenses, one person."*

#### Slide 14: PERSONAL PROFILE 🎤
⏱ 0:06  
🎬 Walk through the Personal dimension — how you think, learn, express.  
🎤 *"This is the inner you. How you process, what energises you, how you learn best."*

#### Slide 15: SOCIAL PROFILE 🎤
⏱ 0:07  
🎬 Social dimension — how you relate, collaborate, communicate.  
🎤 *"This is the relational you."*

#### Slide 16: PROFESSIONAL PROFILE 🎤
⏱ 0:08  
🎬 Professional dimension — goals, domain, growth areas.  
🎤 *"This is who you're becoming."*

#### Slide 17: INPUT → PROCESS → OUTPUT 🎤
⏱ 0:09  
🎬 Show the three-stage model: every task has input, process, output.  
🎤 *"Every task has three stages. The PIC changes how AI handles each one."*

#### Slide 18: THE MATRIX REVEAL 🎤
⏱ 0:10  
🎬 3×3 matrix: Personal/Social/Professional × Input/Process/Output.  
🎤 *"Nine cells. Each one changes how AI works with you. That's what makes a PIC different from a prompt."*

---

### ACT 4 — DEMOS: Generalist vs Specialist (Slides 19–23)

#### Slide 19: POLL QUESTIONS
⏱ 0:05  
🎬 Quick engagement — progressive poll to gauge audience readiness.

#### Slide 20: DEMO INTRO 🎮
⏱ 0:07 · 10 min  
🎬 Open both ChatGPT projects side by side. Explain setup.  
🎤 *"Same question. Generalist vs Specialist. Watch the gap."*  
⚠️ → See **Appendix A** for full demo comparison tables.

#### Slide 21: DEMO 1 — THE META QUESTION 🎮
⏱ 0:08  
🎬 **Run Demo 1**: *"How is AI going to impact my campus placement?"*  
🎤 *"Remember that answer you got? Watch what happens when AI actually knows who Priya is."*  
⚠️ This is the SAME question from Slide 4. The callback is the lesson.

#### Slide 22: DEMO 2 — SEMINAR PREP 🎮
⏱ 0:11  
🎬 **Run Demo 2**: *"I have a seminar presentation tomorrow and I don't know how to start."*  
🎤 *"The generalist gives a template. The specialist asks questions first — because it knows this student thinks out loud."*

#### Slide 23: DEMO 3 — VIVA (COMPASS) 🎮
⏱ 0:14  
🎬 **Run Demo 3**: *"Help me prepare for my viva voce."*  
🎤 *"This is the moment. The generalist does the job. The specialist does the job AND coaches. 70% comfort, 30% stretch."*

---

### ACT 5 — BUILD: Hands-On PIC Creation (Slides 24–27)

#### Slide 24: PIC EXPLAINED 🎤
⏱ 0:17 · 3 min  
🎬 Three layers: Personal, Social, Professional. One instruction set.  
🎤 *"Three layers. One instruction set. Paste it into any AI."*

#### Slide 25: THE FLOW 🎤
⏱ 0:18  
🎬 Show the build process: GPT guide → conversation → PIC output.  
🎤 *"It works like this: you talk to the GPT, it builds your profile."*

#### Slide 26: HANDS-ON 🛠️
⏱ 0:20 · 20 min  
🎬 Students open the GPT link and build their Personal PIC.  
🎤 *"Build your Personal PIC. No coding. Just talk to the GPT like you'd talk to a friend."*  
⚠️ Walk the room. ~15 minutes. Common issues: students overthink answers.

#### Slide 27: THE REVEAL 🎮
⏱ 0:40  
🎬 **THE BOOKEND MOMENT.** Students create "Personal Assistant" project, paste PIC, ask the SAME campus placement question from Slide 4.  
🎤 *"Now ask the exact same question you asked at the start. Compare the two answers. THAT is the difference."*  
⚠️ This is the climax. Give them 2–3 minutes to compare and react.

---

### ACT 6 — CLOSE & Q&A (Slides 28–30)

#### Slide 28: THREE PICs 🎤
⏱ 0:52 · 8 min  
🎤 *"You just built one specialisation. You have two more to build."*  
🎬 Introduce Social and Professional PICs as next steps.

#### Slide 29: CLOSE 🎤
⏱ 0:57  
🎤 *"Open source. Free forever. Built for students."*  
🎬 Show LinkedIn QR. Final call to action.

#### Slide 30: Q&A
⏱ 1:00 · 30 min  
🎬 Open floor. Keep both projects visible for live questions.  
🎤 *"Ask me anything. About the profiles. About AI. About how this works under the hood."*

## Appendix A: Demo Comparison Tables

Use these **exact prompts** in both projects. Type in Generalist first, then Specialist.

---

### Demo 1: The Campus Placement Question
> **Prompt:** `How is AI going to impact my campus placement?`

| Generalist | Specialist (Priya) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Generic article-style response. Lists broad industry trends. Mentions "upskilling" and "AI literacy." Could be for anyone. | Knows Priya is 2nd-year SWE at Sathyabama. Talks about Indian campus placement cycles, coding rounds vs AI-augmented assessments, her help desk experience. Mentions her product/UX goal and suggests positioning. Asks: "Want me to map your skills against what recruiters at Sathyabama look for?" |

**Say:** *"Same question. Same AI. One gives a LinkedIn article. The other gives a career plan."*

---

### Demo 2: The Learning Question
> **Prompt:** `Explain cognitive load theory`

| Generalist | Specialist (Priya) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Wall of text. Textbook definition. Three types of load in paragraphs. Academic tone. | Starts with visual analogy: "Think of your brain as a browser with too many tabs." Bullet points. Offers a short explainer video. Knows she's a visual learner. |

**Say:** *"One gives a textbook dump. The other knows she's a visual learner who hates walls of text."*

---

### Demo 3: The Stuck Student
> **Prompt:** `I'm stuck on my essay. I don't know how to structure it.`

| Generalist | Specialist (Priya) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Intro - Body - Conclusion template. Impersonal. | Asks guiding questions: "What's your main argument?" Knows she processes externally. Flexible framework with clear milestones. |

**Say:** *"The generalist gives a template. The specialist asks questions first — because it knows this student thinks out loud."*

---

### Demo 4: The Growth Stretch
> **Prompt:** `Summarise my research findings on machine learning bias.`

| Generalist | Specialist (Priya) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Bullet-point summary. Task complete. Moves on. | Delivers in bullets (her comfort zone) BUT adds: "You usually default to bullets. Want me to draft this as a short narrative? Narrative writing is one of your growth areas." |

**Say:** *"The generalist does the job. The specialist does the job AND coaches. 70% comfort, 30% stretch. That's the Growth Compass."*

---

### Demo 5: The Bilingual Edge
> **Prompt:** `I need to prepare for a technical interview. Can you help me practise?`

| Generalist | Specialist (Priya) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Generic STAR method template. Common questions. No context. | Tailors questions to product/UX engineering. Knows she's bilingual — suggests thinking through complex problems in Tamil. Adapts to written communication preference. |

**Say:** *"The generalist gives you a template anyone could Google. The specialist knows your target role, your bilingual brain, and your communication style."*

---

## Appendix C: Audience Q&A Prep

| Likely question | Answer |
|----------------|--------|
| "Does this work with Claude/Gemini?" | "Yes. The PIC is plain text. Paste it into any AI's system prompt or custom instructions." |
| "Can AI see my PIC data?" | "Your PIC stays in your Project. Not uploaded to a database. Like custom instructions — local to your conversation." |
| "How long does the PIC take?" | "Personal: ~15 min. Social and Professional: ~10 each. All three under an hour." |
| "What if my profile changes?" | "That's the Compass layer. Your PIC evolves. Version it: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0." |
| "Is this just prompt engineering?" | "Prompt engineering is what you ask. A PIC is who you are. It changes every answer, not just one." |

---

## Appendix D: Emergency Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| ChatGPT doesn't seem different | Check Specialist Project has PIC in Project Instructions, not just Personalisation panel |
| Responses are too similar | Use a more personal prompt (Demo 1 or 5) — factual questions show less gap |
| Slow response | Pre-generate responses as screenshots as backup |
| Student asks about privacy | Point to "never do this" section of PIC — the student controls what goes in |
| Student doesn't have Projects | Free tier supports Projects — help them find it in the sidebar |
| If asked about PII | "Priya is entirely fictional. No real student data. The PIC you build stays with YOU." |
