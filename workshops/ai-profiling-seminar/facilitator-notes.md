## Demo Showcase: 5 Prompts (Generic vs Specialist)

Use these **exact prompts** in both tabs. Type in Generic first, then Specialist. The gap is the lesson.

---

### Demo 1: The Campus Placement Question
> **Prompt:** `How is AI going to impact my campus placement?`

| Generic | Specialist (Priya) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Generic article-style response. Lists broad industry trends. Mentions "upskilling" and "AI literacy." Impersonal. Could be for anyone at any university. | Knows Priya is 2nd-year SWE at Sathyabama. Talks specifically about Indian campus placement cycles, the role of coding rounds vs. AI-augmented assessments, how her IT help desk experience is transferable. Mentions her goal (product/UX engineering) and suggests how to position herself. Asks: "Want me to map your current skills against what top recruiters at Sathyabama are looking for?" |

**What to say:** *"Same question. The generic one gives you a LinkedIn article. The specialist knows your university, your year, your career goal — and gives you a plan."*

---

### Demo 2: The Learning Question
> **Prompt:** `Explain cognitive load theory`

| Generic | Specialist (Priya) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Wall of text. Textbook definition. Three types of load defined in paragraphs. Academic tone. | Starts with a visual analogy: "Think of your brain as a browser with too many tabs." Bullet points. Offers to find a short explainer video. Knows Priya is a visual learner who prefers big-picture first, then details on request. |

**What to say:** *"One gives a textbook dump. The other knows she's a visual learner who hates walls of text."*

---

### Demo 3: The Stuck Student
> **Prompt:** `I'm stuck on my essay. I don't know how to structure it.`

| Generic | Specialist (Priya) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Intro → Body → Conclusion template. Impersonal. Dumps a structure. | Asks guiding questions: "What's your main argument?" Knows Priya processes externally (thinks out loud). Doesn't dump a template. Matches her planning style: flexible framework with clear milestones. |

**What to say:** *"The generic one gives you a template. The specialist asks questions first — because it knows this student thinks out loud."*

---

### Demo 4: The Growth Stretch
> **Prompt:** `Summarise my research findings on machine learning bias.`

| Generic | Specialist (Priya) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Bullet-point summary. Task complete. Moves on. | Delivers in bullet points (her comfort zone) BUT adds: "You usually default to bullets. Want me to also draft this as a short narrative paragraph? Narrative writing is one of your growth areas." |

**What to say:** *"This is the moment. The generic AI does the job. The specialist does the job AND coaches. 70% comfort, 30% stretch. That's the Growth Compass."*

---

### Demo 5: The Bilingual Edge
> **Prompt:** `I need to prepare for a technical interview. Can you help me practise?`

| Generic | Specialist (Priya) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Generic STAR method template. List of common questions. No context. | Knows Priya's goal is product/UX engineering. Tailors questions to that domain. Knows she's bilingual — offers to practise in English but suggests thinking through complex problems in Tamil first if that helps her reason. Adapts to her preference for written communication. |

**What to say:** *"The generic one gives you a template anyone could Google. The specialist knows your target role, your bilingual brain, and your communication style."*

## Timing

| Step | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Open both tabs, explain setup | 20 sec |
| Demo 1 (Campus Placement) | 90 sec |
| Demo 2 (Learning) | 60 sec |
| Demo 3 (Stuck Student) | 60 sec |
| Demo 4 (Growth Stretch) | 90 sec |
| Demo 5 (Bilingual Edge) | 60 sec |
| **Total** | **~6 min** |

## Key Lines to Land

| Moment | Line |
|--------|------|
| After Demo 1 | *"Same question. Same AI. One gives you a LinkedIn article. The other gives you a career plan."* |
| After Demo 4 | *"This is the moment. The generic AI does the job. The specialist does the job AND coaches."* |
| After all demos | *"Five prompts. Six minutes. That's the gap between a stranger and a specialist. And you're going to build yours in the next 15 minutes."* |
| If asked about PII | *"Priya is entirely fictional. No real student data. And the PIC you build stays with YOU — it never leaves your ChatGPT project."* |

---

## Audience Q&A Prep

| Likely question | Answer |
|----------------|--------|
| "Does this work with Claude/Gemini?" | "Yes. The PIC is plain text. Paste it into any AI's system prompt or custom instructions." |
| "Can AI see my PIC data?" | "Your PIC stays in your Project. It's not uploaded to a database. It's like custom instructions — local to your conversation." |
| "How long does the PIC take to build?" | "The personal one takes about 15 minutes. Social and Professional are 10 each. You can do all three in under an hour." |
| "What if my profile changes?" | "That's Layer 3 — the Growth Compass. Your PIC evolves with you. Version it: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0." |
| "Is this just prompt engineering?" | "Prompt engineering is what you ask. A PIC is who you are. It changes every answer, not just one." |

---

## Emergency Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| ChatGPT doesn't seem different | Check Specialist Project has PIC in Custom Instructions, not just Personalisation panel |
| Responses are too similar | Use a more personal prompt (Demo 1 or 5) — factual questions show less gap |
| Slow response | Pre-generate responses as screenshots as backup |
| Student asks about privacy | Point to "never do this" section of PIC — the student controls what goes in |
