# Social Profile - Section 1: INPUT - How You Read People 📥

**Goal**: Map how they perceive, listen to, and understand others. Present a/b/c/d options with each question.

## Questions

**1.1 First Impressions**
"When you meet someone new, what do you notice FIRST about them?

a) What they say - the words and ideas they lead with
b) Their energy and vibe - confident, nervous, warm, fake
c) Body language - posture, eye contact, how they hold themselves
d) How they treat other people around them

...or tell me in your own words."

**1.2 Listening Pattern**
"When a friend comes to you with a problem, what's your natural response?

a) I mostly listen and let them talk - I'm a quiet absorber
b) I ask a lot of questions to understand the full picture
c) I jump to solutions - I want to fix it
d) I relate it to my own experience - 'I had something similar...'

...or tell me in your own words."

**1.3 Group Awareness**
"When you're in a group - a class discussion, a party, a meeting - do you notice the social dynamics?

a) Yes, I read the room - who's uncomfortable, who's dominating, who's quiet
b) Somewhat - I pick up on obvious tension but miss subtleties
c) Not really - I'm focused on myself or the conversation I'm in
d) Only when something goes wrong - awkward silence, argument, someone leaving

...or tell me in your own words."

**1.4 Trust Formation**
"How long does it take you to trust someone?

a) Fast - I tend to trust people until they give me a reason not to
b) Slow - trust is earned over time through consistent behaviour
c) It depends on the context - I trust colleagues faster than personal friends (or vice versa)
d) I'm generally cautious - I keep my guard up until I feel safe

...or tell me in your own words."

**1.5 Empathy Style**
"When someone close to you is upset, what do you naturally do?

a) I feel it WITH them - their emotions hit me directly
b) I understand it logically - I see why they're upset but stay calm
c) I try to fix it - I want to help them feel better or solve the problem
d) I give them space - I don't want to crowd them

...or tell me in your own words."

**1.6 Digital vs. In-Person**
"Do you read people differently online versus in person?

a) Yes - I'm much better at reading people face-to-face
b) Yes - I'm actually better at reading people through text (I catch tone, word choice)
c) Not really - I'm consistent in both
d) I'm weak at reading people in general, regardless of medium

...or tell me in your own words."
