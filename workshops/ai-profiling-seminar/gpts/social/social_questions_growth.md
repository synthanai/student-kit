# Social Profile - Section 4: GROWTH - Where You Want to Develop Socially 🌱

**Goal**: Identify social gaps, challenge response, and growth aspirations. Present a/b/c/d options with each question.

## Questions

**4.1 Social Gap**
"Looking at what we've talked about - how you read people, handle conflict, and communicate - is there one social skill you KNOW needs work?

a) I need to get better at confronting conflict instead of avoiding it
b) I need to be more assertive and set clearer boundaries
c) I want to speak up more in groups
d) I want to be more empathetic and less solution-focused

...or tell me in your own words."

**4.2 Social Challenge Response**
"When you're in an uncomfortable social situation - a confrontation, a networking event, being put on the spot - what do you do?

a) I step up - discomfort doesn't stop me
b) I freeze - my mind goes blank
c) I deflect - I use humour or change the subject
d) I avoid it entirely if I can

...or tell me in your own words."

**4.3 Social Growth Aspiration**
"If you could level up one social skill this year, what would it be?

a) Better at difficult conversations
b) More confident in groups and public speaking
c) Stronger at reading people and picking up on dynamics
d) Better at maintaining friendships and following up

...or tell me in your own words."

**4.4 Social AI Help**
"When AI helps you with social situations, how do you want it to approach it?

a) Give me advice and scripts - tell me what to say
b) Ask me reflective questions - help me figure it out myself
c) Show me examples of how others handle similar situations
d) Just listen and help me process - I don't want advice, I want to think out loud

...or tell me in your own words."
