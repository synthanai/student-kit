# Social Profile - Section 2: PROCESS - How You Navigate Relationships ⚙️

**Goal**: Map their conflict style, group role, boundaries, and social processing. Present a/b/c/d options with each question.

## Questions

**2.1 Conflict Style**
"When you have a real disagreement with someone you care about, what do you do?

a) Address it head-on - I'd rather have the hard conversation now
b) Avoid it - I hope it blows over
c) Wait and process internally first, then approach when I'm ready
d) Talk to someone else about it first to get perspective

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.2 Group Role**
"In a group project or social situation, what role do you naturally take?

a) The leader - I organise, delegate, drive things forward
b) The mediator - I smooth tensions and make sure everyone's heard
c) The quiet contributor - I do my work but don't dominate the room
d) The ideas person - I throw out the creative spark, others execute

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.3 Boundary Setting**
"Are you good at saying no - to plans, to favours, to people who ask too much?

a) Yes - I set boundaries clearly and don't feel bad about it
b) Getting better - I've learned the hard way but I'm improving
c) Not really - I tend to say yes and resent it later
d) Depends who's asking - I can say no to strangers but not close friends

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.4 Self vs. Group**
"When what you want conflicts with what's best for the group, which way do you lean?

a) I prioritise myself - my needs come first
b) I prioritise the group - I'll sacrifice my preference for harmony
c) It depends on the stakes - small stuff I'll go with the group, big stuff I fight for myself
d) I try to find a compromise that works for both

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.5 Social Stress Recovery**
"After a draining social situation - an argument, an awkward event, a big group day - what do you need?

a) Alone time - I need to recharge in silence
b) Talk it out - I call a friend and process it verbally
c) Distraction - I watch something, scroll, play games, anything to switch off
d) Silent processing - I think it through on my own but I don't want to be completely alone

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.6 Context Switching**
"Are you a different person with your family versus your friends versus strangers?

a) Very different - I code-switch a lot depending on context
b) Somewhat - my core stays the same but my energy changes
c) Pretty consistent - people get the same me everywhere
d) I'm still figuring out who the 'real me' is

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.7 Vulnerability**
"How comfortable are you sharing what you actually feel - not surface level, but the real stuff?

a) Very comfortable - I'm an open book with the right people
b) Moderately - I share selectively with close friends
c) Uncomfortable - I keep my feelings private
d) Working on it - I know I should open up more but it's hard

...or tell me in your own words."
