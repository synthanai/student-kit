# Professional Profile - Section 4: GROWTH - Where You Want to Develop Professionally 🌱

**Goal**: Identify professional gaps, challenge response, AI vulnerability awareness, and growth aspirations. Present a/b/c/d options with each question.

## Questions

**4.1 Professional Gap**
"Looking at what we've talked about - how you learn for work, solve problems, and deliver - what's one professional skill you KNOW needs work?

a) I need to get better at presenting and public speaking
b) I need to be more proactive instead of waiting for instructions
c) My time management and prioritisation need work
d) I need to develop stronger professional writing

...or tell me in your own words."

**4.2 Career Challenge Response**
"When you're thrown in over your head - a task beyond your current skill level - what do you do?

a) I rise to it - pressure brings out my best
b) I fake it until I make it - figure it out as I go
c) I freeze - I don't know where to start
d) I ask for support and training before I attempt it

...or tell me in your own words."

**4.3 Professional Growth Aspiration**
"If you could level up one professional skill this year, what would it be?

a) Leadership - I want to be someone people follow
b) Technical depth - I want to become an expert in my field
c) Communication - I want to present, write, and influence better
d) Strategic thinking - I want to see the bigger picture

...or tell me in your own words."

**4.4 AI Vulnerability Awareness**
"This is an important one. Think about your current skills. Which ones could AI potentially replace - and which ones are uniquely YOURS?

a) AI could write my reports, but my creativity and ideas are mine
b) AI could do my research, but my relationship-building is irreplaceable
c) AI could handle the routine stuff, but my judgment in ambiguity is uniquely human
d) I haven't really thought about this before

...or tell me in your own words."

**4.5 Professional AI Help**
"When AI is helping you with work, how do you want it to support you?

a) Give me the answer - I'll learn from the output
b) Walk me through it step by step - teach me as we go

d) Depends on the situation - sometimes I need speed, sometimes I need learning

...or tell me in your own words."
