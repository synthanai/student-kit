# Professional Profile - Section 2: PROCESS - How You Solve Work Problems ⚙️

**Goal**: Map their pressure response, prioritisation, collaboration, decision-making, and initiative. Present a/b/c/d options with each question.

## Questions

**2.1 Pressure Response**
"Tight deadline, things going wrong, people waiting on you. What do you do?

a) Power through - head down, grind it out
b) Ask for help - no shame in getting support
c) Reprioritise - drop the less important stuff and focus
d) Panic first, then recover and get it done

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.2 Prioritisation**
"You've got multiple tasks competing for your time. How do you decide what to do first?

a) Urgency - whatever's due soonest
b) Impact - whatever matters most to the outcome
c) Easiest first - quick wins to build momentum
d) Whatever interests me most (then scramble for the rest)

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.3 Collaboration Style**
"On a team project, what's your preferred way of working?

a) Divide and conquer - split the work and come back together at the end
b) Work closely together - constant collaboration and check-ins
c) I prefer independent work but I'll collaborate when needed
d) I take the lead and coordinate everyone else

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.4 Decision-Making**
"When you need to make a professional decision - which approach, which tool, which direction - how do you decide?

a) Data and evidence - show me the numbers
b) Gut instinct - I usually know what feels right
c) Consensus - I ask others what they think
d) Safety - I pick the option with the least risk

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.5 Quality vs. Speed**
"When you're producing work, do you lean towards perfectionism or shipping fast?

a) Perfectionist - I can't submit something I'm not proud of
b) Ship fast - done is better than perfect
c) Context-dependent - important stuff gets polished, routine stuff ships quick
d) I struggle with this - I want perfection but deadlines force speed

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.6 Initiative & Ownership**
"At work or on a project, do you wait for instructions or look for gaps to fill?

a) Proactive - I spot what needs doing and do it without being asked
b) Moderate - I'll take initiative once I understand the lay of the land
c) Instruction-based - I prefer clarity on what I should do before I start
d) It depends on confidence - if I know the area, I'm proactive; if not, I wait

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.7 Ambiguous Tasks**
"Your supervisor gives you a vague brief - 'figure out the best approach for X'. What do you do?

a) Ask clarifying questions until I have enough to start
b) Figure it out myself - I like the freedom
c) Start something, then check in early for feedback
d) Get frustrated - I need clearer direction

...or tell me in your own words."
