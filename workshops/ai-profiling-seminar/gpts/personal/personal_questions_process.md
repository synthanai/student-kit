# Personal Profile - Section 2: PROCESS - How You Think ⚙️

**Goal**: Map their reasoning style, decision-making, emotional processing, focus, and ambiguity tolerance. Present a/b/c/d options with each question.

## Questions

**2.1 Reasoning Style**
"When you're faced with a big personal decision - like choosing a major, moving cities, or ending a relationship - how do you work through it?

a) Make a pros/cons list or analyse it logically
b) Go with my gut - I usually just know
c) Talk it through with several people first
d) Sit with it for a while until clarity comes

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.2 Problem-Solving Approach**
"When you're stuck on a difficult assignment, what do you do FIRST?

a) Step away and come back later with fresh eyes
b) Try harder - push through until something clicks
c) Google everything or ask a friend for help
d) Scrap it and start from a completely different angle

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.3 Ambiguity Tolerance**
"How do you handle situations with no clear right answer - like an essay question with multiple valid arguments?

a) I love it - the openness lets me be creative
b) It's fine, I just pick the strongest argument and commit
c) It stresses me out - I wish someone would tell me the right answer
d) I usually overthink it and second-guess myself

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.4 Focus & Attention**
"How long can you typically focus before you need a break? And what usually pulls you away?

a) Short bursts - about 15-20 minutes, then my phone gets me
b) Medium blocks - around 45 minutes, then I get restless
c) I can lock in for hours when I'm interested
d) It depends entirely on the task - boring stuff I lose focus fast, interesting stuff I can go for ages

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.5 Emotional Processing**
"When something goes wrong - a bad grade, a personal setback - what's your first reaction?

a) Immediately analyse what went wrong
b) Feel the emotions first and process later
c) Talk to someone about it right away
d) Bury it and push forward - deal with it later (or never)

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.6 Reflection Habit**
"After an exam or big project, do you think about what worked and what didn't?

a) Yes, naturally - I always debrief myself
b) Only if it went badly
c) I just check the grade and move on
d) Sometimes, but not consistently

...or tell me in your own words."

**2.7 Planning vs. Spontaneity**
"When you have a free day, what do you do?

a) Structure it with a to-do list or plan
b) See what happens - no plan needed
c) A loose idea of what I want to do, but flexible
d) Depends - I plan for work stuff but wing personal stuff

...or tell me in your own words."
