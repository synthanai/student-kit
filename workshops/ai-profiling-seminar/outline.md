## Section Details

### 1. The Hook  -  AI Is Coming For Your Skills (5 min)

**Goal**: Create urgency. Make it personal.

- Open with a live ChatGPT demo: ask it to "write a professional email" → show the generic output
- Ask the room: *"How many of you use ChatGPT the same way  -  open a new chat, ask a question, get a generic answer?"*
- Drop the line: *"In the AI era, your **profile** is your **strategy**. If AI doesn't know who you are, it treats you like everyone else. And 'everyone else' is replaceable."*
- Show the poster / slide: **Day 1 vs Day 30**  -  generic AI vs personalised AI

### 2. The Matrix  -  The 3×3 Profiling Framework (8 min)

**Goal**: Teach the framework. Make it stick.

Present the 3×3 matrix:

|  | 📥 Input | ⚙️ Process | 📤 Output |
|--|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 🧠 **Personal** | How you learn | How you think | How you express |
| 🤝 **Social** | How you read people | How you navigate relationships | How you communicate |
| 💼 **Professional** | How you absorb work knowledge | How you solve work problems | How you deliver results |

**Explain each axis:**

- **Input** = how you CONSUME information (learning style, listening, research habits)
- **Process** = how you THINK THROUGH things (reasoning, decisions, problem-solving)
- **Output** = how you PRODUCE and EXPRESS (writing, presenting, communicating)

**Explain each domain:**

- **Personal** = how you operate as an individual (your inner operating system)
- **Social** = how you operate with people (your social interface)
- **Professional** = how you operate at work (your professional engine)

**The AI vulnerability overlay:**
- *"Professional Output is the cell AI replaces fastest  -  report writing, data analysis, presentations. Personal Input is the cell AI can't touch  -  how YOUR brain learns. The question is: do you know which cells are your strengths and which are your gaps?"*

### 3. The Demo  -  Same Question, Two AIs (10 min)

**Goal**: Show  -  don't tell  -  why profiling matters. This is the WOW moment.

**Setup**: Two ChatGPT Projects open side by side (or switch tabs).
- **Project A**: Empty instructions (generic ChatGPT)
- **Project B**: Loaded with a sample student's PIC profile

**Run 3 comparative prompts, revealing the difference:**

**Demo 1  -  Learning (Input difference)**
> Prompt: *"Explain the concept of cognitive load theory to me"*
- **Generic AI**: Standard textbook explanation, paragraphs, formal
- **Profiled AI**: Knows this student prefers video-style summaries and learns big-picture first → gives a metaphor, then 3 bullet points, then offers to go deeper

**Demo 2  -  Problem-solving (Process difference)**
> Prompt: *"I'm stuck on my essay. I don't know how to structure the argument."*
- **Generic AI**: Gives a template (intro, body, conclusion)
- **Profiled AI**: Knows this student is intuitive and processes externally → asks guiding questions instead of giving answers, offers to brainstorm out loud

**Demo 3  -  Output stretching (Compass in action)**
> Prompt: *"Help me write a summary of my research findings"*
- **Generic AI**: Writes a bullet-point summary
- **Profiled AI**: Writes in their preferred format (bullets) BUT adds: *"I noticed you always default to bullet points. Want me to draft this as a short narrative paragraph too? Building narrative writing is in your growth areas."*

**Pause and ask the room**: *"Which AI would you rather use every day  -  the one that treats you like a stranger, or the one that knows your brain?"*

### 4. The Tool  -  Meet Your Profile GPTs (5 min)

**Goal**: Explain the system and the workflow.

- Show the 3 GPTs: **Personal** | **Social** | **Professional**
- Each one is a 15-20 min conversation that profiles you across Input, Process, Output
- At the end, you get a **PIC instruction set**:
  - **Layer 1: Persona**  -  who you are
  - **Layer 2: Interface**  -  how AI should serve you
  - **Layer 3: Compass**  -  how AI should grow you (70% serve, 30% stretch)
- You paste the instructions into a **ChatGPT Project**
- **Memory** handles evolution  -  your AI learns and adapts over time
- When you've changed, come back to the Profile GPT and rebuild → paste the new version

**Show the workflow visually:**
```
Profile GPT → 15-min chat → PIC instruction set → paste into Project → Memory evolves → revisit to upgrade
```

### 5. Hands-On  -  Build Your Personal Profile (20 min)

**Goal**: Students build their first profile RIGHT NOW.

- Share the link to **Student GPT - Personal**
- Students open it on their phones or laptops
- The GPT walks them through ~15 questions conversationally
- At the end, they get their PIC Personal instruction set

**Facilitator tips:**
- Walk the room. Help anyone stuck.
- After 15 min, announce: *"If you're not quite done, that's fine  -  you can finish after. But let's look at what the GPT produced for those of you who are done."*
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share one surprising observation from their profile

### 6. The Reveal  -  Load It, Test It, See the Difference (7 min)

**Goal**: Students see their OWN personalised AI for the first time.

- Guide students through:
  1. Create a new ChatGPT Project (e.g., "My Study Partner")
  2. Paste their instruction set into Project Instructions
  3. Start a conversation: *"Explain [topic from their course] to me"*
- They see the AI respond in THEIR style  -  their format, their tone, their depth

- Ask: *"Does that feel different from normal ChatGPT?"*
- Point out: *"That's just Day 1. Memory hasn't kicked in yet. Day 30 is when it gets scary good."*

### 7. The Close  -  What's Next + Q&A (5 min)

**Goal**: Create momentum. Give them the path forward.

- *"You've built Row 1  -  your Personal profile. There are 2 more rows:"*
  - 🤝 **Student GPT - Social**  -  do this when you're ready
  - 💼 **Student GPT - Professional**  -  do this when you're ready
  - Each adds a new dimension. Together, they complete your 3×3.

- **The one-liner they take away**:
  > *"In the AI era, the people who win aren't the ones who use AI the most  -  they're the ones AI understands the best."*

- Open for 2-3 questions
- Share GPT links via QR code / LMS / handout

---

## Pre-Seminar Setup

1. Create **Project A** (generic)  -  empty instructions, fresh project
2. Create **Project B** (profiled)  -  paste in a full PIC sample profile (use one you've built yourself or a fictional example student)
3. Test all 3 demo prompts in both projects to confirm the difference is visible
4. Publish the Personal GPT and test the link works
5. Prepare QR code with links to all 3 GPTs
