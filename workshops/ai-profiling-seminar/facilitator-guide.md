# Facilitator Guide — AI Profiling Seminar

## Pre-Seminar Setup (30 min before)

### 1. Create Demo Projects
- **Project A (Generic)**: Create a ChatGPT Project with empty instructions
- **Project B (Profiled)**: Create a ChatGPT Project with a full PIC sample profile pasted in

Use a fictional student or your own profile for Project B. The sample should include clear preferences (e.g., "learns through video, concise bullet points, intuitive thinker") so the contrast is visible.

### 2. Test Demo Prompts
Run these 3 prompts in BOTH projects to confirm the difference is clear:

1. *"Explain the concept of cognitive load theory to me"*
2. *"I'm stuck on my essay. I don't know how to structure the argument."*
3. *"Help me write a summary of my research findings"*

If the responses look too similar, make the sample profile more specific.

### 3. Publish the GPT
- Ensure Student GPT - Personal is published and accessible
- Test the link on a different device/account
- Generate a QR code pointing to the GPT link

### 4. Room Setup
- Projector showing your ChatGPT screen (2 projects side-by-side or tabbed)
- QR code handout printed or ready to project
- Wi-Fi credentials visible (whiteboard or slide)

## Delivery Tips

### The Hook (5 min)
- Open with the live generic ChatGPT demo — make it boring on purpose
- The line *"If AI doesn't know who you are, it treats you like everyone else"* should land like a punch
- Don't explain the fix yet — just create the problem

### The Matrix (8 min)
- Draw or project the 3×3 grid
- Pick ONE cell to illustrate deeply (e.g., Personal Input) — don't explain all 9
- The AI vulnerability overlay is the "aha" moment — lead with *"Professional Output is the cell AI replaces fastest"*

### The Demo (10 min)
- This is the WOW moment — take your time, don't rush
- Show Project A response first (boring, generic) → pause → then Project B (personalised, specific)
- Let the room react between each comparison
- Demo 3 is the key one — when the profiled AI gently stretches (suggests narrative writing instead of bullets), students see the Compass in action

### Hands-On (20 min)
- Walk the room! Students will have questions
- Common issues: "I don't know which answer to pick" → remind them there are no wrong answers
- If someone finishes early, have them ask a classmate to compare profiles
- At 15 min, announce "wrap up if you can, we'll look at results"

### The Reveal (7 min)
- Guide them through creating a Project and pasting
- Their first personalised response is the payoff — give them a moment to read it
- Ask 1-2 people to share: "How was that different from normal ChatGPT?"

### The Close (5 min)
- The one-liner they take away: *"In the AI era, the people who win aren't the ones who use AI the most — they're the ones AI understands the best."*
- Project the QR code and leave it up during Q&A

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Student doesn't have ChatGPT Plus | They can still run the profile conversation; pair with a Plus user for the paste-and-test step |
| GPT responses are too slow | Busy period — have a backup screenshot of expected results |
| Room has no Wi-Fi | Pre-download materials; focus on demo, defer hands-on to after seminar |
| Student says "my profile seems wrong" | Profiles evolve — they can redo it anytime. First attempt is always rough |
